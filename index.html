								<h1>Why this house?</h1>
							</div>
							<p class="article-content">
								Our house takes away many of the non-eco-friendly things that are found in many other homes, including:

							<div class="article-title">
								<h3>Energy</h3>
							</div>
							<p class="article-content">
								Geothermal energy is taken from the heat on earth<br/>
								Illinois energy is 7% natural gas, 30% coal, 54% nuclear, and 10% renewables.<br/>
								Most of the nation use nuclear energy, which is 36% of the nation.<br/>
								Most of the nation uses nuclear energy; also geothermal energy. This energy is present around the nation, and is a cheap source of energy to use. Another part of the nation uses natural gas as their energy, and this is also a cheap source of energy to use, it is also efficient.<br/>

								<h3>Food Production</h3>
							</div>
							<p class="article-content">
								Majority of meat in the U.S. is made under “factory conditions” where animals live in extremely close proximity to one antother and disease is rampant. A majority of beef is produced in these conditions that the Environmental Protection Agency deems “concentrated animal feeding operations”. Massive amounts of cows can be bad for the environment, but lamb has twice the carbon footprint, and certain seafood, corn, and other meats are bad for the environment.
							</p>
							<div class="article-title">
								<h3>The Factories</h3>
							</div>
							<p class="article-content">
								The most common factory air pollutants are greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. Factories contribute to water and land pollution by acidifying rain, chemical spills and disposal of toxic waste. <br/>
								Factories use fossil fuels to produce the products, these fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide which increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the air. Factories also cause harm to the natural environment, the waste from the factories make the nutrients in the water that was already present at abnormal rates. This causes death of marine life. The ozone layer is also harmed as a result of waste from factories, the ozone layer protects the world from ultraviolet rays, however the ozone layer is getting closer to the ground due to built up greenhouse gases which becomes harmful to human tissue, and crops.<br/>
